## 2 Single monochromatic absorption-only homogeneous volume

1. Change the absorption parameters to zero in scenes/volpath_test/volpath_test1.xml. What do you see? Why?  
I see the emision of the sphere get brighter. This is because when the absorption gets smaller, the 
L1 term will also get bigger so less light get absorped therefore brghter.  

2. In the homework, we assume the volume being not emissive. If you were tasked to modify the pseudo
code above to add volume emission, how would you do it? Briefly describe your approach.
